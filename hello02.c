/*
    hello02.c - Get and set variables

 This example shows:
    * how the 'stack' is used to transfer data to/from the VM
    * how to pass a value to a script as a global variable
    * how to retrieve a value from the VM
 
 Communication between C and Lua happens within the 'stack', which is a data
 structure held within the VM. Lau objects must stay within the VM.
 
 The "pushstring()" function takes a C string, copies it into a Lua object,
 then pushs that object onto a stack. At this point, scripts and Lua
 functions can manipulate the Lua object.
 
 One such function is "setglobal()", which pops a Lua object off the stack
 and assigns it to a global variable with the given name.
 
 The "getglobal()" function works in reverse. It makes a copy of the named
 global variable, then pushes it on the stack.
 
 Functions like "tointeger()" and "tostring()" copy values out of the stack
 back into C variables.
